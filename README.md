# Digit_Recognization

In this project we have tried to recognize handwritten digit (0 - 9). The dataset was imported from sklearn dataset library i.e mnist dataset .<br>
We built end to end LogisticRegression model to predict handwritten digit . <br>
## Steps
Initially we imported mnist dataset of shape (70000,785) data and target had category of 0 to 9 digits<br>
Splited the data as test_size = 0.2 <br>
Imported LogisticRegression model and trained the training dataset <br>
Predicted test dataset
#### Accuracy achieved was about 92%
